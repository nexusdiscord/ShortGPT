# What is ShortGPT?

ShortGPT is a powerful framework for automating content creation. It simplifies video creation, footage sourcing, voiceover synthesis, and editing tasks. With ShortGPT, you can automate the entire process of creating short videos and generate engaging content with AI.

## Why ShortGPT?

ShortGPT was created to address the challenges faced by content creators in the process of video creation. It can be time-consuming and labor-intensive to source footage, generate scripts, and edit videos manually. ShortGPT automates these tasks, allowing content creators to focus on the creative aspects of their work.

## Key Features of ShortGPT

- **Automated Editing Framework**: ShortGPT streamlines the video creation process with an LLM (Large Language Model) oriented video editing language. It simplifies the editing process and allows for efficient content creation.

- **Scripts and Prompts**: ShortGPT provides ready-to-use scripts and prompts for various LLM automated editing processes. These scripts and prompts can be customized to suit your specific needs and creative vision.

- **Voice Dubbing**: ShortGPT supports voiceover synthesis in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, Arabic, French, Polish, German, Italian, and Portuguese. You can easily generate voiceovers for your videos, adding a professional touch to your content.

- **Caption Generation**: ShortGPT automates the generation of video captions, saving you time and effort in the captioning process. You can ensure that your videos are accessible to a wider audience by including accurate captions.

- **Asset Sourcing**: ShortGPT can automatically source images and video footage from the internet, connecting with the web and utilizing APIs like Pexels to access a wide range of visual assets. This makes it easy to find and incorporate relevant visuals into your videos.

- **Memory and Persistency**: ShortGPT ensures long-term persistency of automated editing variables with TinyDB. This allows you to save and retrieve editing settings, making it easy to maintain consistency across your video projects.
